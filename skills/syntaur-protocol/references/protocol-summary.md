## Assignment Lifecycle

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `pending` | Not yet started |
| `in_progress` | Actively being worked on |
| `blocked` | Manually blocked (requires `blockedReason`) |
| `review` | Work complete, awaiting review |
| `completed` | Done |
| `failed` | Could not be completed |

## Valid State Transitions

| From | Command | To |
|------|---------|-----|
| pending | start | in_progress |
| pending | block | blocked |
| in_progress | block | blocked |
| in_progress | review | review |
| in_progress | complete | completed |
| in_progress | fail | failed |
| blocked | unblock | in_progress |
| review | start | in_progress |
| review | complete | completed |
| review | fail | failed |

## Key Rules

1. **Assignment frontmatter is the single source of truth** for all assignment state.
2. **Project-nested assignments** live at `projects/<slug>/assignments/<aslug>/` (folder name = slug). **Standalone assignments** live at `assignments/<uuid>/` (folder name = UUID, `project: null`, slug display-only).
3. **Derived files** (underscore-prefixed, plus `manifest.md`) are never edited manually.
4. **Slugs** are lowercase, hyphen-separated.
5. **Dependencies** are declared via `dependsOn` in assignment frontmatter. Only valid within the same project — standalone assignments cannot declare `dependsOn`.
6. An assignment cannot transition from `pending` to `in_progress` while any dependency is not `completed`.
7. **Playbooks** in `~/.syntaur/playbooks/` define behavioral rules agents must follow. Read them before starting work.
8. **Todos** in `## Todos` of `assignment.md` is an informal markdown checklist. Items may be simple tasks or markdown links to plan files. When a plan is superseded, mark the old todo `- [x] ~~Execute [plan](./plan.md)~~ (superseded by plan-v2)` — never delete. `## Todos` is also the landing spot for cross-assignment `syntaur request` entries.
9. **Progress** is appended to `progress.md` as timestamped entries (newest first). Do NOT add a `## Progress` section to `assignment.md` — protocol v2.0 moved progress to its own file.
10. **Comments** are appended to `comments.md` via `syntaur comment <slug> "body" [--type question|note|feedback] [--reply-to <id>]`. Never edit `comments.md` directly. Questions carry a `resolved` flag toggled in the dashboard.
11. **Cross-assignment work** is requested via `syntaur request <target> "text"` — appends to the target's `## Todos` annotated `(from: <source>)`.
12. **Agent sessions** in `syntaur.db` must use real agent-runtime session IDs. Synthesized UUIDs are rejected. Plugins for Claude Code / Codex populate `.syntaur/context.json` with the real id via a SessionStart hook; other agents should source it from their runtime and pass `--session-id` explicitly.
